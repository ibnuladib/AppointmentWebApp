# Baymax Care

Welcome to Baymax Care, a comprehensive doctor's appointment system designed to facilitate seamless interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Our application streamlines the appointment scheduling process, ensuring that patients have easy access to medical care while allowing doctors to manage their schedules effectively.

## CaseStudy
In our country, the healthcare system is quite inefficient as it wastes time as at times patients need to come to the clinic or hospital to book an appointment and wait for it, in other scenarios it also wastes resources too as clerks are needed to manage appointments, including making calls or receiving calls in queries to doctors or appointments. So, our goal was to make the process entirely online and make booking more efficient by reducing the time, effort and resources it takes to book an appointment. 

In our system, Patients can sign up with all their necessary details and are authenticated using their email address. They can give their past medical records and details and update their profile. They can search for doctors and see their past reviews. Once they find the one they want to book an appointment with. They can then create an appointment at the available time slots. A transaction responding to the appointment will be created. The Patient can view the transaction and pay it. The doctor will receive a notification concerning the Appointment and can prepare for it via looking through the Patientâ€™s medical history. 
An Administrator will manage all records of Patients, Doctors and Reviews to moderate through it when deemed necessary. 
All these actions will be done through a user-friendly interface.

## MVC Architecture

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web applications similar to Monolythic Architecture. It separates the application into three interconnected components:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a96750d-37d8-40dc-8540-b76ac5e1589b)  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0776718-20d6-446f-aa76-304793662833)


- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. In Baymax Care, this includes models like `ApplicationUser`, `Appointment`, `Review`, and `Transaction`, which define how data is stored and interacted with.
- **View**: Represents the user interface and displays the data from the model to the user. Views handle the presentation layer, allowing users to interact with the application.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It processes user inputs, manipulates the model, and updates the view accordingly. Controllers handle the application's logic and direct the flow of data.

## Configuration with `appsettings.json`

The `appsettings.json` file is a configuration file used in ASP.NET Core applications. It allows you to manage application settings, including database connection strings, logging configurations, and various application-specific settings.

### Key Sections of `appsettings.json`

- **Connection Strings**: This section contains the connection string to your database. You will need to update this string to match your database configuration:
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ApplicationDbContextConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=AppointmentWebAppDemo;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
  }
    ```
- **Logging**: This section defines how logging is handled within your application. You can adjust the log levels for different categories to control the verbosity of logging output:
    ```json
    "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"

  }
    ```
- **Application Settings**: You can add custom settings for your application, such as feature flags or external service configurations.
